#Astrophere

An open source, free game for Unity3D written in Javascript and C#. I am in the process of translating more
of the scripts into C# for personal enrichment and I am currently planning to expand the level to add more interesting game
design features. A large majority of the textures, sounds, and models come standard with the Unity editor or from opengameart.org. 

A majority of the code can be viewed in Assets/Scripts.

The game can be played here: (Full Screen is Recommended)
